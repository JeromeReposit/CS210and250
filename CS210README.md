#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The clock program was a program to display two different time zone clocks. The problem to solve was how to display 2 different clocks to the output while being able to add time when the user wanted to.

#What did you do particularly well?
Particularly what I did well was incorporating an addhour,addminute, and addsecond method while using a do while statements. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I can enhance my code by creating a more compact style of a program through the use of built in functions with the following programming language. This would improve my code because the readability of the program would be simple.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What I found most challenging in this project would be creating the add time methods to the program. To overcome this problem, I used resources that were given to me in the zybooks and develop integral tests.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Skills that will be particularly transferable in projects or course work would be the use of libraries.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In order to make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I made sure to run tests that passed all of the parameters that I have set.
